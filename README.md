# Injury-Classification-with-OSHA-Severe-Injury-Report-Data
This is a sample project for my application to Brown University's Sc.M Data Science program. The project analyzes OSHA's Severe Injury Reports dataset, with the goal of identifying the strongest predictors of certain types of injuries using features from the dataset. At a high-level, I began with feature engineering with Alteryx, then conducted EDA with Tableau and Python, identifying patterns that warranted further exploration and guided feature selection. Finally, I coded a model to use the selected features to predict injury types. Applications for this project could include a suite of software tools for occupational safety professionals to better anticipate and prevent workplace injuries.  
## Data
Data Source: [OSHA Severe Injury Reports](https://www.osha.gov/severe-injury-reports)

### Data Dictionary for Important Features:

**Event Date**: The date the reported injury occurred  
**Primary NAICS**: The industry the injured employees worked in  
**General Nature**: Broad categories of the nature of the injury (i.e., fracture, soreness, puncture wounds, etc.) based on codes in the feature Nature
